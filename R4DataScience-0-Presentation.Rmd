# Introduction

## Outline

- Introduction
    + Who are we ("we"=teachers & students)
    + Why are we here (Why learn R?) 
- How will we proceed: Methodology
- HW Data Science approach to using R
- References & Resources


## Who are we (1): The Statistics and Bioinformatics Unit

## Why learn R

- Most people in most jobs have to _manage_ information in their every day work.
- "Managing" may mean different things such as: 
    + _retrieving_
    + _manipulating_
    + _visualizing_
    + _analyzing_
    + _reporting_
    
- R is a powerful tool that can be used to facilitate, improve or automate tasks such as those described above.

## Your turn

- Provide examples of informations you may wish to manage
- Describe briefly 
    + what this information is about
    + how it is stored
    + what you may wish to do with it
        - Transformations
        - Computations
        - Reports

## How we will work

- Mastering R requires as many other disciplines
    (i) Time 
    (ii) Study, and 
    (iii) Practice.
    
- Our lectures will have the following structure (all but the first)

    + 1st part: Discuss the work you have done during the week
    + 2nd part: We introduce a few new ideas
    + 3rd part: Practice exercises and start working on the case study suggested/your data.
    
## Resources and references

- There is a huge variety of resources to learn R, books, tutorials, free online courses, etc.
- This course is based on the book [Data Science for R](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
