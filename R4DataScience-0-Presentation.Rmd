# Introduction

## Outline

- Introduction
    + Who are we ("we"=teachers & students)
    + Why are we here (Why learn R?) 
    +     - Objectives and competences
    +     - Course contents
- How will we proceed: Methodology
- HW Data Science approach to using R
- References & Resources

- A first contact with R & Rstudio



## Who are we (1): The Statistics and Bioinformatics Unit

## Who are we (2): Teachers

## Why learn R

- Most people in most jobs have to _manage_ information in their every day work.
- "Managing" may mean different things such as: 
    + _retrieving_
    + _manipulating_
    + _visualizing_
    + _analyzing_
    + _reporting_
    
- R is a powerful tool that can be used to facilitate, improve or automate tasks such as those described above.

## Your turn

- Provide examples of informations you may wish to manage
- Describe briefly 
    + what this information is about
    + how it is stored
    + what you may wish to do with it
        - Transformations
        - Computations
        - Reports

## How we will work

- Mastering R requires as many other disciplines
    (i) Time 
    (ii) Study, and 
    (iii) Practice.
    
- Our lectures will have the following structure (all but the first)

    + 1st part: Discuss the work you have done during the week
    + 2nd part: We introduce a few new ideas
    + 3rd part: Practice exercises and start working on the case study suggested/your data.
    
# A first contact with R, Rstudio and the `tidyverse`

## [What is R?](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)

- R is a _language and environment_ for statistical computing and graphics.

- R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.


- It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems Windows and MacOS.

## R PRO's (why you are here!)

- The system is 
    + free (as in _free beer_)
    + It's platform independent
    + It is constantly improving (2 new versions/year)
    
- It is a statistical tool
    + Implements almost every statistical method that exists
    + Great graphics (Examples)
    + Simple reporting tools
    + Also state-of-the-art in Bioinformatics through the [Bioconductor Project](http://bioconductor.org).

- Programming language
    + Easy to automate repetitive tasks (Example_1.1)
    + Possibility to create user friendly web interfaces  with a moderate effort. (Examples)
    
## R CON's

- R is mainly used issuing commands from a console
    + less user friendly that almost any other statistical tool you may know.
    
- Constantly having new versions may affect our projects

- Not necessarily the best language nor suitable for every existing task

## Using R

- Traditionally R was used from an Operating System console ("Terminal")

- This is an intimidating approach for many users

- A variety of options exist to decrease the learning curve.

    + Use a supportive development environment such as **Rstudio**
    + Use an interface to Statistical tools, such as **Rcommander** or ::DeduceR** allowing to concetrate an Statistics, not in commands.

## An "enhanced" console: Rstudio
